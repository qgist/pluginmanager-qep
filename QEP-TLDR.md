# TL;DR

Although not overly complicated from a pure technical point of view, this QEP is an unusual long one. Certain gaps in QGIS' relationship to the Python ecosystem make QGIS fall far behind its true potential. This document proposes to close the gaps. However, figuring out an actually good, sustainable solution - not just any solution - is not trivial. It requires a thorough analysis of (1) the problem, (2) all possible options forward and (3) potential pitfalls. Unfortunately, the topic of Python modules and packaging is also paved with common misconceptions. This QEP has therefore intentionally been developed in great detail in a [separate GitHub repository](https://github.com/qgist/pluginmanager-qep). The following table of contents provides direct links to the individual chapters of the QEP within the separate repository. Once the discussion ends, a final version of this QEP might replace this "TL;DR" section.
